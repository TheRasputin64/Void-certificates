## what it does
* uploads certificate templates (your hopes)
* lets you set text position (with dead precision)
* batch generates certificates (because human touch is overrated)
* saves time (but what is time anyway)

## features
- drag & drop template (like dropping responsibilities)
- text customization (font, color, size... if you still care)
- bulk name input (paste & forget)
- preview before generating (last chance to regret)

## known issues
- existence
- works better than my social life
- saves too much time (now what?)
- automated sadness
